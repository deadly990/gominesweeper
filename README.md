# Game Modes:

## Classic

Classic mode is the Minesweeper we all know and love. Sometimes you will have a board with a 50-50 chance of a mine. We do realise that many people love this and some don't. Minesweeper is a logic game afterall!

## No-Guess

Most Minesweeper apps will include this mode, which generates a board that is guaranteed to be solvable by using the deductive logic of Minesweeper. No more will you have an infuriating toss up at the end of your board. 

## Campaign

In this special mode, the player gets the opportunity to solve pre-determined boards. This mode can be great for beginners to learn some of the basic patterns and logic from the easier levels, yet get increasingly difficult to challenge their minds in the harder levels.
In addition, these boards will all be No-Guess boards.

## Challenge

In challenge mode, players will be given a daily minesweeper challenge typically with a much smaller board and an elaborate logic puzzle.
